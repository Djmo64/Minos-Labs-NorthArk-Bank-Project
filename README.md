# NorthArk Bank Project

NorthArk Investment Bankâ€™s front office team (Client Facing roles that generate revenue) has the need of a web facing tool where their clients can view/ analyze their bank account transactions and create reports in real time.

## Installation

For now we are in still in development so please fork then clone the repo.
1. cd (change directory) into client then run 'npm install' or 'yarn install' to install dependencies.
2. Run 'npm start' or 'yarn start' to start development for the front end.
3. cd back into root directory and cd into server and 'npm install' or 'yarn install' to install dependencies.
4. Run 'npm start' or 'yarn start' to start development for the backend.
5. Backend must be running to test hitting a mock database.

### Things to Note

- Please do not include package.json locked version in pull requests.
- Backend is a mock database so there is no database connection.
- There are only two routes for the time being. Get users and Get userById.
